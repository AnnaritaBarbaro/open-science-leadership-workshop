# Introducing Open


###Goals: 

1. Learn what "open" and "working open" mean generally
2. Understand how the world wide web and web techologies have supercharged the open movement.
3. Understand what "working open" can mean for science and scientific research.
4. Learn about the ways that Mozilla Science Lab is encouraging communities to work in the open, and how you can get involved. 

###Time:
* 10 minutes to read and explore resources 

###What is "Working Open," and why scientists care?

"Working open" (for the purposes of this guide) is an approach and set of practices for creating and building  stuff, anything from software and hardware to learning materials to scientific research. 

When you're working open, you: 

Invite other people, "contributors" to work on the project-- anyone with some level of skill who has an interest can pitch in.

Make decisions and 


It's way of working where outsiders can become insiders


###What's the Web (and Mozilla) got to do with it?
This guide was generated by Mozilla Science Lab

Firefox browser, an open source project 
The foundation was created to support and grow this way of working, and encourage

###Open Science Practice and Possibilities

###Mozilla Science Labs


Before defining the **how** of working open, it's worth spending some time thinking about why you would want to.

Working open is **not** a way to get free engineering or other labour for your project, although you can find efficiencies you wouldn't have found otherwise when you help people solve their own problems.

Working open is **not** a way to hit your deadline faster, and in fact you should be prepared for the reality that having a community around your project will require intention and mindfullness on your part.

Working open is **not** a way to avoid process or structure, and done properly should make power structures transparent and participatory.

It **is** a way to introduce new perspectives, incorporate user-centric thinking, and allow your project to achieve it's highest impact.

It can sharpen your thinking and find errors you hadn't known you'd made.  This is expressed in the "many eyes" principle or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law Linus's Law]:  "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". In other words, the more people involved, the more likely someone is to spot an error.

Increasing the amount of contributors can also increase the diversity of your project and make sure that it serves a wide constituency.  In the words of Aspiration technology's Allen Gunn:

>"I believe in the “many eyes” principle — but also in the **“many hearts and souls”** principle. Having many personalities, values and experience-sets involved in creating something intrinsically makes the finished product more robust and broadly relevant — versus, say, three privileged white guys in Silicon Valley kicking something out."
