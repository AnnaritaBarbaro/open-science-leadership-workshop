**Total time:** 10-15 mins

This is a fun, quick group activity & experiment in using de-jargonised, plain langague to talk about (sometimes quite complex) open science ideas, projects, tools, and practice. The aim is to simplify our definitions and explanations so they're accessible to newcomers and ultra-clear in our own minds. 
 
We'll use the [XKCD Up-goer Five Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/), which limits us to only the top ten-hundred most common words (that's the top one thousand most common words, but it turns out that "thousand" isn't on that list). 

1. Brainstorm a list of the most common terms that are used in open science (code review, gitHub, open data, etc) (2-3 mintues)

2. Break into groups of three or four and, using the [XKCD Up-goer Five Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/), create short definitions for each (or a selection of 5) terms; include a statement on why people in open science should care about this term. Add your definitions to the Etherpad (link here) (5-7 mins)

4. Report back: Insights? Thoughts? What was challenging or suprising? (3-4 mins)
